# Implementation-Biased Test Generation - LLM test-generation study

Principle `ORACLEBIAS`, phase P4 VERIFY. Apply "Implementation-Biased Test Generation - LLM test-generation study" to the work of the P4 VERIFY phase.

Every probe's expected value comes from the row's pre and post conditions and the signature, never from the function body. Write each expected value beside the contract clause it came from. A value copied from the code it checks is discarded and re-derived by a verifier that has not read the body. When an assertion mirrors the code, the backreference to G_INDEP fires: re-enter the gate with a fresh verifier whose SESSION_ID has never been used in this chain.

The walk is recorded by the transition that leaves this node.
