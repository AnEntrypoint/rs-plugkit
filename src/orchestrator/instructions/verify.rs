pub const TEXT: &str = r#"# VERIFY

COMPLETE is earned, not declared. Three preconditions: git clean, pushed to remote, CI green. Any one missing means the phase has not concluded.

## CI Is The Build

For Rust crates (rs-exec, rs-codeinsight, rs-search, rs-learn, rs-plugkit) and the gm publish chain, `git push` triggers the build matrix across six target platforms. `cargo build` and `cargo test` are not run locally — a local build covers exactly one platform and proves nothing about the other five. Push, watch CI, fix on red. Toolchain mismatches and rustc skew never block a push.

Watch protocol: after push, poll `gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 3 --json status,conclusion,name` until the run completes, up to `GM_CI_WATCH_SECS` (default 180). On red, triage the failure shape (import error → check manifests; type error → snake to PLAN; test failure → root cause; lint → fix in-band; build timeout → re-trigger once, else PRD `blockedBy: external`). Fix at root, push, re-watch. Green CI is the precondition for VERIFY → COMPLETE.

## Single Integration Test

One `test.js` at project root. 200-line hard cap. No fixtures, no mocks, no scattered test files. The VERIFY phase runs it. Failure = regression to EXECUTE. Prefer compaction over expansion when editing: merge groups, drop redundancy.

## Residual-Scan Gate

Before allowing transition to COMPLETE, fire the `residual-scan` verb. Empty PRD is necessary but not sufficient — the gate asks what the agent should have decided to do but did not. Either re-enter PLAN with appended items and execute, or explicitly state "residual scan: none reachable in-spirit." The `.gm/residual-check-fired` marker makes this one-shot per stopping window. Common residuals: pre-existing build break surfaced this turn, neighboring lint failure, obvious refactor win, observability gap, doc drift, follow-on work the user clearly implied.

## Unsolicited-Doc Residual

Untracked `*.md` or `*.txt` files landed during the turn — at project root, under `docs/`, or anywhere outside `node_modules/` / `target/` / `.gm/` — are residuals. The disposition is delete-or-fold: if the content belongs in the commit message, the PRD entry, or a `memorize-fire`, move it there and delete the file; if it does not, just delete. SUMMARY.md, COMPLETED.md, IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md, START-HERE.md, *-STATUS.md, build-output.txt, log.txt are the canonical examples — they do not survive into the commit. A new doc the user explicitly requested is the only exception, and the user's ask is the proof.

## Git Gate

`git status` clean. `git log` shows the commit pushed. `gh run list` shows the most recent run for the branch concluded green. All three witnessed before transition.

## Dispatch

`phase-status`, `transition`, `residual-scan`. Spool the CI watch through `in/bash/` so timeouts respect the spool budget.

Transition: residual-scan clear AND git clean AND CI green → dispatch `transition` to advance to COMPLETE. Anything else → dispatch `transition` back to PLAN or EXECUTE per the gap.
