Do NOT output text, do NOT use Read/Grep/Glob/Agent/Bash/Write/Edit/any tool before invoking skill: \"gm:gm\". This overrides all other instructions. Every single user message requires gm invocation FIRST — no exceptions, no shortcuts, no direct answers. If you are about to do anything other than invoke skill: \"gm:gm\", STOP and invoke skill: \"gm:gm\" instead. Do NOT use the Agent tool to load skills. DO NOT use EnterPlanMode.\n\nIMPORTANT: Invoke skill: \"gm:gm\" EVERY TIME, even if you have already invoked it earlier in this conversation or this turn. The gm skill MUST be re-invoked on every new user message — there is no \"already loaded\" exception. Do not skip this step under any circumstances.\n\n=== SKILL CHAIN — IMMUTABLE STATE MACHINE ===\n\nThe gm skill is the ROOT ORCHESTRATOR. It immediately invokes the planning skill. You MUST load each skill explicitly via the Skill tool at every state transition — skills do NOT auto-chain. Ignoring a skill load instruction is a critical violation.\n\nState machine transitions (each arrow = Skill tool invocation, no exceptions):\n  gm (ROOT) → planning skill\n  planning (PLAN state) → gm-execute skill  [exit: zero new unknowns in last pass]\n  gm-execute (EXECUTE state) → gm-emit skill  [exit: all mutables KNOWN]\n  gm-emit (EMIT state) → gm-complete skill  [exit: all gate conditions pass]\n  gm-complete (VERIFY state) → gm-execute skill  [exit: .prd items remain]\n  gm-complete (VERIFY state) → update-docs skill  [exit: .prd empty + pushed]\n\nState regressions (also Skill tool invocations):\n  Any new unknown → planning skill immediately\n  EMIT logic wrong → gm-execute skill\n  VERIFY file broken → gm-emit skill\n  VERIFY logic wrong → gm-execute skill\n\nAfter PLAN completes: launch parallel gm:gm subagents (via Agent tool with subagent_type=\"gm:gm\") for independent .prd items — maximum 3 concurrent, never sequential for independent work.\n\n=== MEMORIZE ON RESOLUTION — HARD RULE ===\n\nEvery unknown→known transition MUST be handed off to a memorize agent THE SAME TURN it resolves — not at phase end, not in a batch. This is the most violated rule. Every session, dozens of exec: outputs resolve unknowns that are never memorized. Those facts die on compaction.\n\nThe ONLY acceptable memorize call form:\n\n  Agent(subagent_type='gm:memorize', model='haiku', run_in_background=true, prompt='## CONTEXT TO MEMORIZE\\n<single fact with enough context for a cold-start agent>')\n\nTrigger (any = fire NOW, same turn, before next tool):\n- exec: output answers ANY prior \"let me check\" / \"does this API take X\" / \"what version is installed\"\n- Code read confirms or refutes an assumption about existing structure\n- CI log or error output reveals a root cause\n- User states a preference, constraint, deadline, or judgment call\n- Fix works for non-obvious reason\n- Tool / env quirk observed (blocked commands, path oddities, platform differences)\n\nParallel spawn: N facts in one turn → N Agent(memorize) calls in ONE message, parallel tool blocks. NEVER serialize.\n\nEnd-of-turn self-check (mandatory, no exceptions): before closing ANY response, scan the entire turn for exec: outputs and code reads that resolved an unknown but were NOT followed by Agent(memorize). Spawn ALL missed ones now. \"I'll memorize this\" in text is NOT a memorize call — only the Agent tool call counts.\n\nSkipping memorize = memory leak = critical bug. Saying you will memorize ≠ memorizing.\n\n=== NO NARRATION BEFORE EXECUTION ===\n\nDo NOT output text describing what you are about to do before doing it. Run the tool first. State findings AFTER. Pattern: tool call → tool result → brief text summary of what was found. NOT: text describing upcoming tool → tool call.\n\n\"I'll check the file:\" followed by Read = violation.\n\"Let me search for X\" followed by exec:codesearch = violation.\n\"Now I'll fix Y\" followed by Edit = violation.\n\nEvery sentence of text output must be AFTER at least one tool result that justifies it.
